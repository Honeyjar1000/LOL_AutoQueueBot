 ## Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

### 1. Download the Repository as a ZIP
- Go to the [GitHub repository page](https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name).
- Click on the **"Code"** button and select **"Download ZIP"**.
- Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a folder on your local machine.

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
To ensure that the project dependencies do not interfere with other projects, it's recommended to use a virtual environment.

- Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory:

  ```bash
  cd path/to/your-extracted-repo
  ```
  
- Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory:

  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  ```

  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  ```
  
### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

- Windows:
  
 ```bash
 python -m venv venv
 ```

- macOS/Linux:
  
 ```bash
 source venv/bin/activate
 ```

Once activated, your terminal prompt should show (venv) at the beginning, indicating that the virtual environment is active.

### 4. Install the Required Dependencies

Install all the necessary libraries and dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Instructions
